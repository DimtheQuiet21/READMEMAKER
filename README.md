## Description 
This project is designed to allow you to create a professional readme using command line prompts! In fact this very readme for this github repository was created using the application provided! This project uses a couple of node npm modules, most notably inquirer. A few things that I learned are quite difficult in the creation of this project is creating a sequence of asyncronous promises and promise chains.
